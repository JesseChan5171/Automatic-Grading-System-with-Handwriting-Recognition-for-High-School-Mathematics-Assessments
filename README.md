# Abstract

This project is an automatic grading system which aims to reduce the repetitive marking of mathematics teachers and help them have more time on preparing teaching material. The need of balancing workload of teachers is very paramount in any school. Workload of teachers has increased with extra administrative tasks and new teaching methods due to the pandemic. The whole system can be divided into three parts. First, a self-design assessment schema is generated by using computer vision tools, it allows teachers to generate different questions and answers with a given topic. Second, the answer sheet can be divided into parts according to the question and extract each answer row which consists of digits, variables or operators written from the student. Third, the handwriting recognition program will perform the recognition on the answer row. The system is using neural network model for recognition and is trained by the CROHME dataset, a collection of handwritten math expression. It can perform answer recognition for designed topics. A graphical user interface is also provided for input answer sheet, monitoring and controlling the marking process.
